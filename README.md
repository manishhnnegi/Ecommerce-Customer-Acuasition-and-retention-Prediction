# customer-database
The project looks at financial planning issue an E-Commerce firm is facing-should the firm focus on its mobile app or website ? 

For this, I thought the most feasible way for the firm to approach this would be by focusing on the service that customers spend most time on, regardless of whether or not they make purhcases. So, in this project I attempt at creating a quantifiable relationship between the the time spent on App or Website vs Length of the Membership. 

The coefficient matrix that was found from the model is following: -

                          Coeff
Avg. Session Length   25.981550

Time on App           38.590159

Time on Website        0.190405

Length of Membership  61.279097
